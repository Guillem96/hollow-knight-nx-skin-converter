This tool converts Hollow Knight Skins designed for PC to Nintendo Switch.

> To use a Hollow Knight skin in your switch you need 
[atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) installed.

## Disclaimer ⚠️

Atmosphere is required to install Hollow Knight Skins on your Nintendo Switch.

Atmosphere is a Custom Firmware (CFW) which means that your Nintendo Switch must be hacked (modded, etc. whatever you want to call it), but if you use a legit Hollow
Knight copy, you are still supporting team cherry, Nintendo and everyone involved
in the game. Therefore you are not breaking any law.

Install Atmosphere at your own risk.

## Install a Custom Knight Skin

1. Navigate to this [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DsV8DLH9cR9kU6-HRVgOhS99Pl6NXedr?usp=sharing) and download the skin you prefer. For example the Tanjirou one. <br> <img src="images/drive-download.jpg" width=500>

2. Unzip the skin. Once unzipped you should see this folder: <br> <img src="images/unzipped-skin.jpg" width=400>

3. Copy the `0100633007D48000` folder in your sd card inside the `atmosphere/contents`. <br> <img src="images/atmosphere-contents.jpg" width=400>

3. Restart your switch using atmosphere.

4. Launch the game and enjoy the skin!
