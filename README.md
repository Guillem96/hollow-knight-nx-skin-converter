# Hollow Knight Skin to Nintendo Switch

This tool converts Hollow Knight Skins designed for PC to Nintendo Switch.

> To use a Hollow Knight skin in your switch you need 
[atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) installed.

## Disclaimer ⚠️

Atmosphere is required to install Hollow Knight Skins on your Nintendo Switch.

Atmosphere is a Custom Firmware (CFW) which means that you Nintendo Switch must be hacked (moded, etc. whatever you want to call it), but if you use a legit Hollow
Knight copy, you are still supporting team cherry, Nintedo and everyone involved
in the game. Therefore you are not breaking any law.

Install Amtmosphere at your own risk.
